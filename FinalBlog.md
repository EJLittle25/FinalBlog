# Final Project Writeup
## Project: The Making of Duke Men’s Basketball’s Social Media Presence
------

### Conceptual Description

For my first project in the class, I made a very rudimentary Hello World sketch that revolved around Duke basketball. It attempted to capture that excitement and spirit that students at Duke campus display with regards to Duke basketball. It was certainly was basic, but it conveyed this message through spinning basketball, flashing icons, and hidden “Easter eggs.” For my final project, I wanted to quantify this excitement, so I decided to look at the engagement with Duke’s media presence. From the viewers per game to the number of followers that different players have, I really dove into Duke’s media following. I wanted to make this interactive as well, so through different graphs that have hovering abilities to links that direct you to their media pages, users are able to play around with the dashboard that I created. I wanted users to be able to take away information regarding how curated and successful Duke Basketball’s media presence has become. I believe that it is a reason why lots of students even look at Duke as a school in the first place and it is a large reason why alumni are still locked into the Duke culture. I wanted users to be able to see this and see how many people are subscribed to Duke’s basketball culture.

### Interaction Description

I see my piece being displayed on a wall or a screen because I set it up in a dashboard format so I feel that it should be shown on a flat surface. I expect users to interact with the piece by using a mouse to scroll over the different graphs to get a more in-depth look at the quantitative data that I compiled. The intended audience is people who are interested in social media and marketing in addition to Duke basketball fans. My piece informs these users through interaction because when users are able to see the numbers associated with the graphs, they will be able to see how large Duke’s following is.

### Extension Description


This piece is an extension of my first piece. As I stated previously, this is an extension of my first project. I subtracted a lot of the abstract nature of that piece and instead chose to focus much more on the quantitative aspect of how passionate people are about Duke basketball. I also cleaned up my project a lot. My first iteration of the project barely had a background, consisted of just shapes, and did not have any interaction at all. This project is a lot cleaner and is much easier to navigate and gather information from. I felt that if I did not have a ReadMe page for my initial project, it would be difficult for users to understand the message that I was attempting to convey. I believe that turning this into a dashboard really helped me develop the interactivity and connection that users are able to have to the piece. The elements that I added also certainly makes the piece more objective which I feel is beneficial because this piece almost does the job of making an argument for how powerful Duke’s media presence is.

### Technical Details


This uses javascript, CSS, Google Font APIs, and it is built on a Bootstrap template. It is being hosted on Github Pages with the link provided below. The code is essentially all compiled within the index and two external js files that contain the graphs. Using the code provided from the template and the styles provided by the CSS, I was able to move things around and fill in the template with different data.
